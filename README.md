# Heart-Disease-Predictiction
The primary objective of this project is to enhance the speed of heart disease diagnosis by approximately 30%, thereby saving valuable time for doctors and medical practitioners. To achieve this, a comprehensive dataset consisting of approximately 70,000 records was utilized to construct various classifier models. The performance of these models was evaluated using accuracy metrics and the Mathews Correlation Coefficient (MCC).

Before developing the models, an in-depth analysis was conducted on the provided dataset, revealing insightful findings. For more detailed information regarding the project and its outcomes, please refer to the heart disease documentation.
